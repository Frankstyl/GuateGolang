                     <p>I am an extremely determined person. No matter what, I will push through limitations and adversity to try and get what I want, and what is best for myself and those around me. Beyond that,
                      I am extremely compassionate and kind, and will do everything and anything for my friends.
                    
                      I am a caring and intelligent person. 
                      I would do anything for my family and everything I do is basically looking out for their needs. I love children a lot and am always looking into everything that has to do with them.Like finding new crafts, events or activities, fun recipes to make for them, or new findings in development or strategies for teaching. I love reading all the time whether it be to my children or enjoy a good Stephen King novel or reading recent studies.I also really like to cook! I’m always looking for new recipes to make or foods to try. I’m also pretty well known for having the Food Network running in my house.
